# Candidate Coding Test

## Please do not fork this repository

## Scenario
The application you will be building is a questionnaire. There is a Web API Service in the solution which will provide you with the questions. The solution uses a hardcoded/mocked repository to avoid using a real data source.

It is expected that you will produce:
* Tested maintainable code
* Clean code and OOP design

You are free to make any changes you feel necessary but it would be good to keep consistency in mind.

## Tasks
1. Using the MVC app in the solution consume the REST Web API service. Display the Questions on a web page along with UI elements for the answers.


If you progress to the next stage you will be given more tasks to continue using your existing solution.
